Facial Recognition System:


🚀 About the Project
The Facial Recognition System is a Python-based application designed to detect and recognize faces from images or video streams. It leverages state-of-the-art machine learning and computer vision libraries to ensure high accuracy and reliability. This system can be seamlessly integrated into applications like:
This project is a Face Recognition-based Attendance System that uses OpenCV for face detection and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for face recognition. It appears to store attendance records in a structured format.

Attendance Tracking
Access Control Systems
Secure Authentication Platforms

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python 3.7+
Libraries:
OpenCV (Image Processing)
Dlib (Face Recognition)
Face_recognition (Face Encoding and Matching)
NumPy (Data Manipulation)
Database: MySQL or SQLite

🌟 Features
📸 Real-Time Face Detection: Automatically detect faces in a live feed or images.
🎭 Face Recognition: Match detected faces with a predefined database.
🔄 High Accuracy: Uses advanced algorithms for precise recognition.
🗃️ Database Support: Easily store and retrieve user data for face matching.
⚡ Scalable: Can handle large datasets of known faces.
